# Sailfort Motors Project: Machine Learning
Project Purpose: With company data, predict employee departure using logistic regression, or machine learning techniques. Make recommendations to reduce employee departure using information from EDA, and feature importances from machine learning models.

A fictional company: Sailfort Motors is having issues with high turnover. I am tasked with building a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company, and to make recommendations to reduce future employee churn. 

The attached jupyter notebook contains my process from EDA, visualizations, feature engineering, building and testing 4 models, selecting the best model, and my recommendations to reduce employee turnover.
